### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: How does religion and science related in the field of Philosophy?
+ This project is conducted by Wenhui Fang

+ Project summary: Socrates once said, “Having the fewest wants, I am nearest to the gods”. Religion seems to be an important topic through the history of philosophy. With the large dataset, we can explore the development of philosophy entangling with religion. Moreover, science is an important topic in the field of philosophy as well and people sometimes believes that religion and science are opposites. Therefore, with the large dataset, we will explore the relationship between philosophy, religion and science by trying to answering the following questions.
1) Does religion and science are opposites in the field of philosophy?
2) Are science and religion often brought up together?
3) How does the sentiment toward science and religion for each school?
4) How does the relationship between philosophy and science, religion change over time?
5) How does the attitude towards science and religion change over the year?

Therefore, to study the contents of philosophy, the topic and the direction of data analysis will be the relationship between science, religion and philosophy.
